# Truchet

Hello! This is a thing I made to learn ClojureScript and Reagent. It's a toy for making graphics based on Truchet tile patterns.

## Build

First, ensure that you have Node.js and Java SDK 8 installed.

Then, navigate to the repository root and run `yarn install` (if you have Yarn) or `npm install` to install dependencies.

Now you can build the application as a static site by running `shadow-cljs release app` or simply `yarn release`.

## Run

After installing dependencies, use `shadow-cljs watch app` or `yarn watch` to run the app in a development server.
